 <h1 class="here-header">Who we are.</h1>
  <p class="about-text">We are a group of students that created this prototype website for the girlCode x Aritzia hackathon. <br>&nbsp<br> Our amazing team is formed by: Rui Xiang Yu, Rachel Xia, Fatma Nilgun Abali and Maskeen Kaur.  <br>&nbsp<br> The purpose of this website is to offer wheelchair users an accessible way for online shopping and furthermore, to help people find a color palette that will fit them.  <br>&nbsp<br> Due to all of us being beginners in coding, there were a few limitations to our website that could be improved further:  </p>
  
  <ul class="about-li">
    <li>The color picker website is unfinished. Due to lack of time and experience, we were not able to implement a fully functional color picker. However, we finished a figma demo.</li>
    <li>Our filter function does not cover the entirety of Aritzia's clothing due to lack of time. Furthermore, the clothing items's tags are fixed (one item can be size S, but not more sizes at the same time). It also lacks many important filters (such as color). Thus, it is not a perfect filter system. </li>
    <li>We believe the main function of this website could be included in other ways such as creating an extension for it, adding an "accessibility" filter to the Aritzia filtering system, including pictures of what the clothes look like while sitting down, and measurements of the clothing item (especially the length).
    <li>Lack of accessibility for other aspects. The main accessibility focus in our website was making it wheelchair-friendly, but there are many other ways to make online shopping accessible. Some examples are focusing on visual impairments and audiovisual obstacles.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="about-text">Despite these limitations, we are all very proud of this final product and we hope fashion becomes more accessible in the future. Thank you for browsing this website!</p>
